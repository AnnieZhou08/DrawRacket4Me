<h3> What is it? </h3>
Hate Racket syntax? Have a ton of test cases for graphs and trees? 
We all know it's a waste of time drawing the diagrams out to verify whether our code is correct. 
**But don't worry, *DrawRacket4Me* got your back!**<br>
Simply copy and paste your code from DrRacket into DrawRacket4Me, it will automatically draw out the structure for you, whether it's trees with a list of children, or graphs with cycles. <br>

<h4> Here's an Example </h4>
<table>
<tr>
<td> <img src = "images/demo_code1.PNG" width = "350px"></td> <td> <img src = "images/demo_tree1.PNG" width = "400px"> </td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3> How to Run it? </h3>
